# Rock vs Mine Prediction  

This project is a **Machine Learning classification model** that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a **Rock** or a **Mine (Metal Cylinder)**. The dataset used is the **Sonar dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Uses sonar signals to classify objects as **Rock** or **Mine**.  
- Implements supervised machine learning algorithms.  
- Includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Model training & evaluation  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of 208 samples with 60 sonar frequency features.  
- **Label "R"** → Rock  
- **Label "M"** → Mine  

## ⚙️ Steps in the Notebook  
1. Import required libraries.  
2. Load and explore the dataset.  
3. Perform **data preprocessing** (handling labels, normalization, etc.).  
4. Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / SVM).  
5. Evaluate the model with accuracy scores.  
6. Make predictions on new data.
